The Expense Tracker is a Python program designed to assist users in managing their finances by tracking their expenses. 
It allows users to input their details, set a monthly budget, and then record their expenses. Users can enter details for each expense, including the name, amount, and category. The program then saves this information to a file. Additionally, it provides functionality to summarize the user's expenses, categorize them, calculate the total spent, and determine the budget remaining. Finally, it offers a visualization of expenses by category through a bar chart using matplotlib.
